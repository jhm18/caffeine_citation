1,"Short- and medium-term impact of bariatric surgery on the activities of CYP2D6, CYP3A4, CYP2C9, and CYP1A2 in morbid obesity","Morbid obesity and bariatric surgery induce anatomical, physiological and metabolic alterations that may alter the body's disposition of drugs. Current literature on this topic is limited and sometimes inconsistent. Cytochrome P450 (CYP) is a superfamily of enzymes that metabolize around 75% of all marketed drugs. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the impact of body mass index and bariatric surgery on CYP activities. Firstly, we evaluated the in vivo activity of 4 major CYP isoenzymes (CYP2D6, CYP3A4, CYP2C9, and CYP1A2) in normal weight, overweight, and morbidly obese individuals. Secondly, we assessed the short- (1 month) and medium-term (6 month) effects of the most commonly employed bariatric surgery techniques (laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy and Roux-en-Y gastric bypass) on the activity of these enzymes. CYP3A4 activity was lower in morbidly obese individuals, compared to normal-weight controls. Interestingly, bariatric surgery normalized CYP3A4 activity. In comparison with normal-weight controls, morbidly obese individuals had higher CYP2D6 activity, which was only observed in individuals with two functional alleles for this isoenzyme. Neither body mass index nor surgery had significant effects on CYP2C9 and CYP1A2 activities. Overall, no relevant differences in CYP activities were found between surgical techniques. In conclusion, further studies should evaluate whether the observed alterations in CYP3A4 activity will require dose adjustments for CYP3A4 substrates especially in morbidly obese individuals before and after bariatric surgery.","DRUG-METABOLISM,GASTRIC BYPASS,PHARMACOKINETICS,CAFFEINE,PLASMA,LOSARTAN,ENZYMES,WEIGHT,E-3174,SALIVA"
1,Modulation of CYP450 Activities in Patients With Type 2 Diabetes,"We conducted a comprehensive in vivo study evaluating the influence of type 2 diabetes (T2D) on major cytochrome P450 (CYP450) activities. These activities were assessed in 38 T2D and 35 non-T2D subjects after a single oral administration of a cocktail of probe drugs: 100 mg caffeine (CYP1A2), 100 mg bupropion (CYP2B6), 250 mg tolbutamide (CYP2C9), 20 mg omeprazole (CYP2C19), 30 mg dextromethorphan (CYP2D6), 2 mg midazolam (CYP3As), and 250 mg chlorzoxazone (alone; CYP2E1). Mean metabolic activity for CYP2C19, CYP2B6, and CYP3A was decreased in subjects with T2D by about 46%, 45%, and 38% (P < 0.01), respectively. CYP1A2 and CYP2C9 activities seemed slightly increased in subjects with diabetes, and no difference was observed for CYP2D6 or CYP2E1 activities. Several covariables, such as inflammatory markers (interleukin (IL)-1 ss, IL-6, gamma interferon, and tumor necrosis factor alpha), genotypes, and diabetes-related and demographic-related factors were considered in our analyses. Our results indicate that low chronic inflammatory status associated with T2D modulates CYP450 activities in an isoform-specific manner.","DRUG-METABOLIZING-ENZYMES,CLINICAL-OUTCOMES,TRANSPLANT RECIPIENTS,CYTOCHROME-P450 2E1,EXPRESSION,MELLITUS,LIVER,CLOPIDOGREL,DISEASE,LYMPHOCYTES"
1,Collaborative effects of chlorogenic acid and caffeine on lipid metabolism via the AMPK alpha-LXR alpha/SREBP-1c pathway in high-fat diet-induced obese mice,"To investigate the mechanism of the combined effects of chlorogenic acid (CGA) and caffeine on lipid metabolism in high-fat diet-induced obese mice, eighty female ICR mice were randomly divided into eight groups and fed with a high-fat diet with/without CGA and/or caffeine for 14 weeks. The combination of CGA and caffeine effectively decreased body weight gain, intraperitoneal adipose tissue weight, serum LDL-c, FFA, TC, TG, leptin, IL-6 concentrations, and hepatic TG and TC levels and increased the serum adiponectin level. The CGA and caffeine combination also promoted the phosphorylation of AMPK alpha, inhibited the expressions of transcriptional regulators (SREBP-1c and LXR alpha), and decreased the expressions of FAS and HMGR. Besides, the expressions of ACO, ATGL and HSL were increased by the CGA and caffeine combinations. The results indicated that the combination of CGA and caffeine had anti-obesity effects and regulated lipid metabolism in high-fat diet-induced obese mice via the AMPK alpha-LXR alpha/SREBP-1c signaling pathway. Thus, chronic CGA and caffeine intakes may be potent for preventing obesity.","ACTIVATED PROTEIN-KINASE,EXPRESSION,AMPK,THERMOGENESIS,CHOLESTEROL,LIPOLYSIS,COFFEE,RISK"
1,A New Method for Classification of Salts and Cocrystals Using Solid-State UV Spectrophotometry,"Salt and cocrystal formulations are widely used as techniques to improve physicochemical properties of compounds. Some spectrometric techniques to distinguish cocrystals from salts have been reported; however, it has not been possible to adapt these formulations with many compounds, because of limitations, high difficulty, and exceptions. Therefore, we focused on the possibility of UV spectrometry, which had not been reported as a classification technique for salts and cocrystals. The integration values of solid-state UV/visible (Vis) spectra of indomethacin salts were larger than those of physical mixtures of indomethacin and counter molecules, while that of indomethacin cocrystal was not large compared with that of the physical mixture. From these results, differences between a salt and a cocrystal were observed in their solid-state UV/Vis absorption spectra for indomethacin complexes. Therefore, it is suggested that solid-state UV/Vis absorption spectra can be used as a new technique to classify salts and cocrystals.","IMPROVING MECHANICAL-PROPERTIES,PHARMACEUTICAL COCRYSTALS,CO-CRYSTALS,SOLUBILITY,INDOMETHACIN,CAFFEINE,BINARY,ACIDS,DRUG"
1,Altered cytochrome 2E1 and 3A P450-dependent drug metabolism in advanced ovarian cancer correlates to tumour-associated inflammation,"Background and Purpose Previous work has focussed on changes in drug metabolism caused by altered activity of CYP3A in the presence of inflammation and, in particular, inflammation associated with malignancy. However, drug metabolism involves a number of other P450s, and therefore, we assessed the effect of cancer-related inflammation on multiple CYP enzymes using a validated drug cocktail. Experimental Approach Patients with advanced stage ovarian cancer and healthy volunteers were recruited. Participants received caffeine, chlorzoxazone, dextromethorphan, and omeprazole as in vivo probes for CYP1A2, CYP2E1, CYP2D6, CYP3A, and CYP2C19. Blood was collected for serum C-reactive protein and cytokine analysis. Key Results CYP2E1 activity was markedly up-regulated in cancer (6-hydroxychlorzoxazone/chlorzoxazone ratio of 1.30 vs. 2.75), while CYP3A phenotypic activity was repressed in cancer (omeprazole sulfone/omeprazole ratio of 0.23 vs. 0.49). Increased activity of CYP2E1 was associated with raised serum levels of IL-6, IL-8, and TNF-alpha. Repression of CYP3A correlated with raised levels of serum C-reactive protein, IL-6, IL-8, and TNF-alpha. Conclusions and Implications CYP enzyme activity is differentially affected by the presence of tumour-associated inflammation, affecting particularly CYP2E1- and CYP3A-mediated drug metabolism, and may have profound implications for drug development and prescribing in oncological settings.","PREGNANE-X-RECEPTOR,SERUM INTERLEUKIN-6,LIQUID-CHROMATOGRAPHY,COLORECTAL-CANCER,CONCISE GUIDE,EXPRESSION,CYTOKINES,CYP2E1,GENE,DISEASE"
1,A non-lethal malarial infection results in reduced drug metabolizing enzyme expression and drug clearance in mice,"BackgroundGiven the central importance of anti-malarial drugs in the treatment of malaria, there is a need to understand the effect of Plasmodium infection on the broad spectrum of drug metabolizing enzymes. Previous studies have shown reduced clearance of quinine, a treatment for Plasmodium infection, in individuals with malaria.MethodsThe hepatic expression of a large panel of drug metabolizing enzymes was studied in the livers of mice infected with the AS strain of Plasmodium chabaudi chabaudi, a nonlethal parasite in most strains of mice with several features that model human Plasmodium infections. C57BL/6J mice were infected with P. chabaudi by intraperitoneal injection of infected erythrocytes and sacrificed at different times after infection. Relative hepatic mRNA levels of various drug metabolizing enzymes, cytokines and acute phase proteins were measured by reverse transcriptase-real time PCR. Relative levels of cytochrome P450 proteins were measured by Western blotting with IR-dye labelled antibodies. Pharmacokinetics of 5 prototypic cytochrome P450 substrate drugs were measured by cassette dosing and high-resolution liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. The results were analysed by MANOVA and post hoc univariate analysis of variance.ResultsThe great majority of enzyme mRNAs were down-regulated, with the greatest effects occurring at the peak of parasitaemia 8days post infection. Protein levels of cytochrome P450 enzymes in the Cyp 2b, 2c, 2d, 2e, 3a and 4a subfamilies were also down-regulated. Several distinct groups differing in their temporal patterns of regulation were identified. The cassette dosing study revealed that at the peak of parasitaemia, the clearances of caffeine, bupropion, tolbutamide and midazolam were markedly reduced by 60-70%.ConclusionsThese findings in a model of uncomplicated human malaria suggest that changes in drug clearance in this condition may be of sufficient magnitude to cause significant alterations in exposure and response of anti-malarial drugs and co-medications.","IN-VITRO METABOLISM,HUMAN LIVER-MICROSOMES,PREGNANE-X-RECEPTOR,HEPATIC CYTOCHROME-P450,FALCIPARUM-MALARIA,PLASMODIUM-BERGHEI,GENE-REGULATION,QUININE,PHARMACOKINETICS,IDENTIFICATION"
1,"Impact of Ethnicity-Specific Hepatic Microsomal Scaling Factor, Liver Weight, and Cytochrome P450 (CYP) 1A2 Content on Physiologically Based Prediction of CYP1A2-Mediated Pharmacokinetics in Young and Elderly Chinese Adults","BackgroundThe vast majority of physiological and biological data required for physiologically based predictions are primarily available in Caucasians rather than other ethnic populations, which leads to a lack of confidence in the application of physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) modeling for ethnicity-specific prediction of pharmacokinetics in the Chinese population.ObjectivesIn this study we recalibrate the system parameters of Chinese-specific PBPK modeling and explore for the first time the relative importance of ethnicity-specific microsomal protein per gram of liver (MPPGL), liver weight, and cytochrome P450 (CYP) 1A2 abundance to the projection of drug disposition mediated by CYP1A2 in young and elderly Chinese adults.MethodsChinese MPPGL levels and associated variability were parameterized and incorporated for the first time into ethnicity-specific PBPK models for the Chinese adults. Parameterization of Chinese liver weights was also recalibrated on the basis of autopsy data from Chinese individuals (n = 4081) across the entire adult age range. Uncertainty surrounding the Chinese-specific CYP1A2 content has also been explored and clarified by conducting ethnicity-related PBPK simulations under different scenarios. Various ethnicity-related or what-if' scenarios for PBPK modeling were implemented to assess the predictive performance and explore the relative importance of ethnicity-specific MPPGL and liver weight to the projection of drug disposition mediated by CYP1A2 in terms of two typical CYP1A2 substrates, caffeine and theophylline, in young and elderly Chinese adults by comparing the predicted concentration-time data and associated pharmacokinetic parameter estimates with observations.ResultsCompared with 0.85, the liver scalar of 0.9 generally produced more accurate liver weight levels in virtual Chinese peers. Additionally, simulated MPPGL levels on the basis of Caucasian data were not able to reflect the age-independent pattern observed in Chinese adults, dissimilar to that on the basis of Chinese-specific adult MPPGL data. The modeling Scenarios A and B provided similar predictions for theophylline pharmacokinetics in young Chinese adults across different age groups, while Scenario B provided the most accurate prediction for theophylline pharmacokinetics in elderly Chinese adults. However, the use of a stratified value of CYP1A2 content derived from a Han Chinese cohort with a small sample size instead of the pooled value of all Chinese cohorts involved regardless of Chinese sub-ethnicity resulted in inadequate prediction of CYP1A2-mediated pharmacokinetics in terms of caffeine and theophylline in either young or elderly Chinese subjects. Additionally, the impact of ethnic-specific MPPGL on predictive accuracy of theophylline pharmacokinetics in elderly Chinese subjects is more evident than that of liver weight.ConclusionWe provided quantitative information pertaining to Chinese-specific levels of liver weight and MPPGL, and recalibrated these system parameters for PBPK modeling for young and elderly Chinese subjects. Uncertainty surrounding the Chinese-specific CYP1A2 content has also been clarified. PBPK modeling based on the recalibrated system parameters can accurately simulate CYP1A2-mediated pharmacokinetics in both young and elderly Chinese adults, particularly in elderly individuals.","IN VIVO EXTRAPOLATION,P450-MEDIATED PHARMACOKINETICS,POPULATION OPPORTUNITIES,N-ACETYLTRANSFERASE,HEALTHY,EXPOSURE,VOLUME,MODEL,CAUCASIANS,DRUGS"
1,Diet-induced obese alters the expression and function of hepatic drug-metabolizing enzymes and transporters in rats,"Obesity increases the incidences of metabolic syndrome, including type 2 diabete, fatty liver, dyslipidemia, hyperglycemia, heart disease, hypertension and cancer. In particular, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of many drugs have changed in obese patients. However, little is known about the hepatic drug-metabolizing enzymes and transporters that are influenced by diet-induced obese. In this report, we established obesity and fatty liver models in male rats by high-fat diet. The expression profiles of drug-metabolizing enzymes and transporters were studied by quantitative real-time PCR and Western blotting analysis. The function of these enzymes and transporters were assessed by their substrates and cocktail methods. The expression and activity of phase I enzymes (CYP1A2, CYP2B1, CYP2C11, CYP3A1, CYP4A1 and FMO1) and phase II enzymes (UGT1A1, UGT1A3, UGT1A6, UGT1A9, UGT2B7, NAT1 and GSTT1) were decreased in the liver of obese rats. In addition, the mRNA levels of hepatic transporter Slco1a2, Slco1b2, Slc22a5, Abcc2, Abcc3, Abcb1a and Abcg2 decreased significantly in obese animals, while Abcb1b increased significantly. Furthermore, the decreased expression of hepatic phase I and II enzymes and transporter may be due to changes of Hnf4 alpha, LXR alpha and FXR. In conclusion, the diet-induced obese altered the expression and function of hepatic drug-metabolizing enzymes and transporters in male rats, thereby impacting drug metabolism and pharmacokinetics.","NUCLEAR RECEPTORS,CYTOCHROME-P450,PHARMACOKINETICS,MODEL,CAFFEINE,DISEASE,CYP3A,FOCUS"
1,Molecular mechanisms of caffeine-mediated intestinal epithelial ion transports,"Background and Purpose As little is known about the effect of caffeine, one of the most widely consumed substances worldwide, on intestinal function, we aimed to study its action on intestinal anion secretion and the underlying molecular mechanisms. Experimental Approach Anion secretion and channel expression were examined in mouse duodenal epithelium by Ussing chambers and immunocytochemistry. Ca2+ imaging was also performed in intestinal epithelial cells (IECs). Key Results Caffeine (10 mM) markedly increased mouse duodenal short-circuit current (I-sc), which was attenuated by a removal of either Cl- or HCO3-, Ca2+-free serosal solutions and selective blockers of store-operated Ca2+ channels (SOC/Ca2+ release-activated Ca2+ channels), and knockdown of Orai1 channels on the serosal side of duodenal tissues. Caffeine induced SOC entry in IEC, which was inhibited by ruthenium red and selective blockers of SOC. Caffeine-stimulated duodenal I-sc was inhibited by the endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ chelator (N,N,N ',N '-tetrakis(2-pyridylmethyl)ethylenediamine), selective blockers (ruthenium red and dantrolene) of ryanodine receptors (RyR), and of Ca2+-activated Cl- channels (niflumic acid and T16A). There was synergism between cAMP and Ca2+ signalling, in which cAMP/PKA promoted caffeine/Ca2+-mediated anion secretion. Expression of STIM1 and Orai1 was detected in mouse duodenal mucosa and human IECs. The Orai1 proteins were primarily co-located with the basolateral marker Na+, K+-ATPase. Conclusions and Implications Caffeine stimulated intestinal anion secretion mainly through the RyR/Orai1/Ca2+ signalling pathway. There is synergism between cAMP/PKA and caffeine/Ca2+-mediated anion secretion. Our findings suggest that a caffeine-mediated RyR/Orai1/Ca2+ pathway could provide novel potential drug targets to control intestinal anion secretion.","CAPACITATIVE CALCIUM-ENTRY,CENTRAL-NERVOUS-SYSTEM,PHARMACOLOGY 2017/18,CONCISE GUIDE,RYANODINE RECEPTORS,ANION SECRETION,CYCLIC-AMP,CA2+,CAMP,CFTR"
1,Lack of Effect of 12-Week Treatment with Risankizumab on the Pharmacokinetics of Cytochrome P450 Probe Substrates in Patients with Moderate to Severe Chronic Plaque Psoriasis,"ObjectiveThe objective of this study was to characterize the effects of risankizumab on the in vivo activity of cytochrome P450 (CYP) 1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, and CYP3A in psoriasis patients using a cocktail approach.MethodsPatients with moderate to severe chronic plaque psoriasis (n=21) received single oral doses of sensitive probe substrates for CYP1A2 (caffeine 100 mg), CYP2C9 (warfarin 10 mg), CYP2C19 (omeprazole 20mg), CYP2D6 (metoprolol 50 mg), and CYP3A (midazolam 2 mg) on day 1, followed by 12 weeks of subcutaneous risankizumab treatment of 150 mg once every 4 weeks from day 8 to day 92, and again the same cocktail of substrates on day 98. Serial blood samples were collected for determination of the CYP probe drugs and metabolites with and without risankizumab. Trough samples were collected for risankizumab.ResultsThe 90% confidence intervals (CIs) for the area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) from time zero to infinity (AUC) ratios for the CYP probe substrates administered with risankizumab versus without risankizumab were within the default 0.8-1.25 equivalence bounds. Similar results were observed for maximum plasma concentration (C-max), except for omeprazole, for which the lower bound of the 90% CI for C-max (0.73) extended slightly below the default equivalence limit. No differences were observed in metabolite-to-parent drug C-max or AUC ratios with risankizumab versus without risankizumab. Risankizumab trough plasma concentrations significantly exceeded those of the phaseIII regimen of risankizumab in psoriasis (150mg subcutaneously at weeks 0 and 4 and every 12weeks thereafter).ConclusionsRisankizumab did not affect the in vivo activity of CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, or CYP3A enzymes in patients with moderate or severe plaque psoriasis and therefore has no potential for drug interactions through these enzymes.Clinical trial registrationClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT02772601.","PROTEIN-DRUG INTERACTIONS,DISEASE,COCKTAIL,POLYPHARMACY,TOCILIZUMAB,MECHANISMS"
1,"Evaluating metronidazole as a novel, safe CYP2A6 phenotyping probe in healthy adults","Aims CYP2A6 is a genetically polymorphic enzyme resulting in differential substrate metabolism and health behaviours. Current phenotyping probes for CYP2A6 exhibit limitations related to procurement (deuterated cotinine), toxicity (coumarin), specificity (caffeine) and age-appropriate administration (nicotine, NIC). In vitro, CYP2A6 selectively forms 2-hydroxymetronidazole (2HM) from metronidazole (MTZ). The purpose of this study was to evaluate MTZ as a CYP2A6 phenotyping probe drug in healthy adults against the well-established method of measuring trans-3-hydroxycotinine (3HC)/cotinine (COT). Methods A randomized, cross-over, pharmacokinetic study was completed in 16 healthy, nonsmoking adults. Separated by a washout period of at least 2 weeks, MTZ 500 mg and NIC gum 2 mg were administered and plasma was sampled over 48 hours and 8 hours, respectively. Correlations of plasma metabolite/parent ratios (2HM/MTZ; 3HC/COT) were assessed by Pearson coefficient. CYP2A6 genotyping was conducted and incorporated as a variable of plasma ratio response. Results Correlations between the plasma ratio 2HM/MTZ and 3HC/COT were >= 0.9 at multiple time points (P < 0.001), demonstrating a wide window during which 2HM/MTZ can be queried post-MTZ dose. CYP2A6 genotype had significant impacts on both MTZ and NIC phenotyping ratios with decreased activity predicted phenotypes demonstrating 2HM/MTZ ratios <= 58% and 3HC/COT ratios <= 56% compared with extensive activity predicted phenotypes at all time points examined in the study (P < 0.05). No adverse events were reported in the MTZ arm while 38% (n = 6) of participants reported mild adverse events in the NIC arm. Conclusions Metronidazole via 2HM/MTZ performed well as a novel, safe phenotyping probe for CYP2A6 in healthy adults.","NICOTINE METABOLITE RATIO,IN-VIVO EVALUATION,DISPOSITION KINETICS,HUMAN PLASMA,GENETIC-POLYMORPHISM,COTININE,SMOKING,SMOKERS,PHARMACOKINETICS,ASSOCIATION"
1,Simulating the Impact of Elevated Levels of Interleukin-6 on the Pharmacokinetics of Various CYP450 Substrates in Patients with Neuromyelitis Optica or Neuromyelitis Optica Spectrum Disorders in Different Ethnic Populations,"A physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) model was used to simulate the impact of elevated levels of interleukin (IL)-6 on the exposure of several orally administered cytochrome P450 (CYP) probe substrates (caffeine, S-warfarin, omeprazole, dextromethorphan, midazolam, and simvastatin). The changes in exposure of these substrates in subjects with rheumatoid arthritis (and hence elevated IL-6 levels) compared with healthy subjects were predicted with a reasonable degree of accuracy. The PBPK model was then used to simulate the change in oral exposure of the probe substrates in North European Caucasian, Chinese, and Japanese population of patients with neuromyelitis optica (NMO) or NMO spectrum disorder with elevated plasma IL-6 levels (up to 100pg/mL). Moderate interactions [mean AUC fold change, 2.08 (midazolam) or 2.36 (simvastatin)] was predicted for CYP3A4 probe substrates and weak interactions (mean AUC fold change, 1.29-1.97) were predicted for CYP2C19, CYP2C9, and CYP2D6 substrates. No notable interaction was predicted with CYP1A2. Although ethnic differences led to differences in simulated exposure for some of the probe substrates, there were no marked differences in the predicted magnitude of the change in exposure following IL-6-mediated suppression of CYPs. Decreased levels of serum albumin (as reported in NMO patients) had little impact on the magnitude of the simulated IL-6-mediated drug interactions. This PBPK modeling approach allowed us to leverage knowledge from different disease and ethnic populations to make predictions of cytokine-related DDIs in a rare disease population where actual clinical studies would otherwise be difficult to conduct.","SINGLE-DOSE PHARMACOKINETICS,DRUG-METABOLIZING-ENZYMES,IN-VITRO,MONOCLONAL-ANTIBODY,CHEMOKINE PROFILES,MESSENGER-RNA,DISEASE,SIMVASTATIN,SUPPRESSION,PREDICTION"
